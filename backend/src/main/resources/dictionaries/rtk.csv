See the fourth bite falling in there?

"Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air ""mooning"" someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)?

Also, the mooning ""ass"" part of it connects well to Hesig´s seemingly unconnected ""flesh"" or ""part of the body"" meaning (when used in primitive form)."
日	日: sun, day, sun radical (no. 72)	day	Open the window, new day.	Picture two halves of a 24-hr period: Day & Night.

山	山: mountain, mountain radical (no. 46)	mountain	Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive this element appears equally as well at the top or bottom of the kanjis (besides appearing to the left). Since a mountain often brings to mind towering peaks, I will consider it implied that the element is placed at the top of the kanji. When this primitive appears at the bottom, I will arrange my story in a way that other elements are said to be at the very top of the mountain (see FRAME 775 for an example).	YOU CAN´T POSSIBLY NEED A MNEMONIC FOR THIS!!!!
川	巛: river, river radical (no. 47)	stream	So as not to confuse this with river (#146) think of streamers falling down.	There are three default I/O Streams in UNIX, stdin, stdout, and stderr.

人	人: human, human radical (no. 9)	person	"Behold Mister T (of ""A-Team"" fame)! I chose Mr.T because he´s sure to make amusing stories. He is a very versatile character since he´s both the big, tough guy and the “moralistic” person, telling kids not “to do drugs or alcohol”. He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”."	[I appreciate some people´s occasional habit of using P for person in shared stories. That makes it easier to substitute Mr. T, Captain Picard, or whomever else a student is using as person.].
名	夕: evening<br>口: mouth	name	In the evening, when it becomes dark, open your mouth to say your name so that people can recognise you.	In the evening, her sweet mouth whispered my name.
女	女: woman, female, female radical (no. 38)	woman	"To remember the order of strokes, remember a female ninja is called a ""kunoichi"". That is, く(hiragana) ノ(katakana) 一(kanji, ichi=one)."	My mother taught me that a woman should always sit with her legs crossed (but the arms can be stretched out).
男	田: rice field; rice paddy<br>力: power; strength; strong; strain; bear up; exert	male	Male is seen here as muscles working in the field, in other words working in the rice fields is the work of the male who are usually stronger.

先	八: eight; eight radical (no. 12)	before	I´ve never seen a cow with human legs before!	"Nasty story but it keeps the meaning true to the kanji.

校	木: tree; wood<br>交: mingle; mixing; association; coming & going	exam	With the exam scores posted on a TREE, the students MINGLED around looking at the results. test. 試.

Examples: 校長 is principal (lit. school chief); 中学校 is junior high school (lit. middle study/knowledge school).
村	木: tree; wood<br>寸: measurement; foot/10	town	If you´ve ever played an old 8 bit or 16 bit RPG, like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy or Inindou, you´ll remember that every town was all bordered off by a line of trees with no space in between to get out through. Imagine that the trees were glued together so you could only exit town through the main or side gates, (so you couldn´t escape the important scripted scenes.).	Pfft. At it´s core, a town is just a bunch of wood glued together. Edit - Stop starring this piece of crap story! xD.
町	田: rice field; rice paddy<br>丁: street; ward; town; counter for guns, tools, leaves or cakes of something; even number; 4th calendar sign	village	Actually this means town, like one that has lots of streets and is surrounded by all the rice fields.

水	水: water, water radical (no. 85)	water	The kanji for water is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes; constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig´s story doesn´t do this).	"For those having issues with this* ""A 7K foot pool of water"" Notice it looks like a 7, and a K. Might have to practice writing it a few times."
火	火: fire, fire radical (no. 86)	fire	For some reason, this kanji reminds me of a person running, her arms (the two drops) raised up, because she caught on fire!	A tepee getting shot at by fire arrows.

糸	糸: thread, string, thread radical (no. 120)	thread	I also went with Spiderman. However, in the cases where this primitive appears under other primitives, as opposed to on the left (I think there are ~5 times in this chapter) I´ve opted to use a similar character: Venom. This helps keep the positioning clear, especially on such characters as dainty (#1363) and accumulate (#1364).	You´ll be seeing this one a lot. Seriously.
貝	目: eye; class; look; insight; experience; care; favor	shellfish	Eye thought I saw a shellfish legging it down the beach!	Stare at the shellfish, it looks like an eye with legs.
車	車: cart, car, car radical (no. 159)	car	My car is so fast it can go through ten rice fields in ten minutes.	"Rather than hobbling along with a walking stick to cross through a span, it´s much better to use a car. (Imagine an old man with a walking stick creeping along a span of road, and you, in a car, whizzing right by him. It´s funny ´cause it´s true.) Also, it´s important to include the word ""through,"" so you know the walking stick goes right THROUGH the span."

赤	土: soil; earth; ground; Turkey	red	He was stabbed with a dagger, and little drops of red blood dropped onto the ground.	There was red all over the soil after Little Red Riding Hood plunged a dagger into the wolf. Those two dots we see are wolfies animal legs we see, by the way (a la smithsonian).
青	月: month; moon	blue	The last time I saw a blue moon was in my youth when I was growing up.	"Once in a blue moon refers to a rare event. But originally ""blue moon"" refers to a full moon, in other words a fully grown-up moon. Whether once a month is rare or not depends on what we´re talking about, but that happens to be the origin of the expression."
白	日: day; sun; Japan; counter for days	white	A white ray is a drop of sun.	Even a small drop (´) of the sun (日) would make you see nothing but white.

万	一: one; one radical (no.1)	ten thousand	I bound ten thousand dollars together and hid it under the floor.	"We have ""one"" at the top and if you turn the kanji 90 degrees you will see arabic 4 shich means it has four zeros in front of it!"
半	丶: dot; tick or dot radical (no. 3)<br>二: two; two radical (no.2)<br>十: ten	half	"Imagine karate chopping the number three in half with a WALKING STICK and pausing the picture just as the first ""board"" breaks."	I think of this as a pictograph, there are three boards to cut, the first one is already in half and there are still two more to go.
形	幵: put together<br>彡: three; hair ornament; short hair or fur radical (no. 59)	shape	Everyone in the kindergarten came up with fun and interesting shapes made out of Play-Doh, except for the kid with the amputated arm. Seems like you really need both hands.	With your two hands, outline the shape of a curvaceous woman. Is that a universally understood gesture? [Careful: mould (#680) which has two hands and soil/clay].
太	大: large; big<br>丶: dot; tick or dot radical (no. 3)	plump	A large person with a big drop of sweat dripping off of him because he is so plump.	"Fat(""plump"") men always have small penises.....the kanji is a combination of ""large"" with a drop(representing the small penis between his legs)."

So here´s my story: The girl´s hair was so long that she had to use staples instead of hairpins. It worked, but stapling her hair to her head was kinda painful.
点	占: fortune-telling; divining; forecasting; occupy; hold; have; get; take<br>火: fire	spot	The FORTUNE TELLER was burned by FLAMES on the spot because she was accused of being a witch.	You have to stimulate the G-spot with your magic wand in order to get her on fire. Or you can juste use your mouth...
丸	九: nine<br>丶: dot; tick or dot radical (no. 3)	round	Nine plus a drop rounds it off to ten!	"Watch out for plump (#120). Here Heisig could have added a ""t"" and we would have had a much better keyword : rotund. Rotund is more specific than ""round"" which begs for confusion with circle (#1811). A dictionary search on ""fat"" or ""round"" doesn´t yield this kanji, but ""rotund"" does! Primitive suggestion: the Laughing Buddha is often depicted as a rotund, smiling bald man in robes with a largely exposed pot belly stomach (symbolizing plenitude)."
交	亠: kettle lid radical (no. 8)<br>父: father	mingle	Even though your FATHER is an old man, he can´t give up his party lifestyle. Once a week he still dons his cool TOP HAT (well, it was cool 40 years ago) and goes out on the town to MINGLE with the ladies. This is a pretty common thing in Japan, where old motherfuckers still think they can pick up 19 year old girls.	Darth Vader tries to mingle with his troops.

The bottom one, in the glass helmet, is under the coat. The top one has his top hat pulled down in disguise, so all you can see is his mouth.	Here we have TWO MOUTHS each wearing a different hat. The top one is wearing a TOP HAT which is know to be as a TALL hat. The bottom one is wearing a SPACE HELMET which is known as an EXPENSIVE hat. (this kanji means both).

父	父: father, father radical (no. 88)	father	Luke, I am your father. Darth Vader (really surprised nobody put this one up before: 2 laserswords).

It´s still weird to me, but apparently reaching to your side and grabbing you neighbor´s crotch is a great way to express friendship.	Think of a sex friend (a fuck buddy if you will). The benefit of such a relationship is that there will always be a crotch by your side. (the Japanese refer to such a friend as セフレ, just as we do).

夜	亠: kettle lid radical (no. 8)<br>人: person<br>夕: evening	night	"Actually, the lower-right primitive isn´t quite ""walking legs."" It´s a little more like ""evening"" with an extra stroke across it (look up the stroke order). So, it helps me to see this kanji for night as: evening plus an extra stroke representing the tuxedo tails to match the top hat which my special person is wearing out on the town..."

週	周: circumference; circuit; lap<br>辶: walk; walking; road radical variant (no. 162)	week	Imagine a road built so well that it takes only a week to travel the circumference of the earth.	Actually the week is like a never ending road where we travel in a circle through the same seven days again and again, the circumference is always the same. circumference (#317) also means circuit or lap, so that also makes think about the rotations of the moon, sun and the earth -- all important for measuring all kinds of time periods.

夏	一: one; one radical (no.1)<br>自: oneself<br>夂: winter radical (no. 34)	summer	In SUMMER you are hot from the top of your head down to your walking legs.	I personally think it was too confusing to try and use head as the primitive. (How am I supposed to remember that the animal legs are replaced with walking legs instead of human legs?) Rather, I think have the image of a hot summer and you want to keep oneself under a ceiling not out jogging around.
秋	禾: 2-branch tree radical (no. 115)<br>火: fire	autumn	In AUTUMN, the WHEAT looks the color of FIRE, meaning it´s time to harvest it.	Every autumn the wheat is set on fire to clear the way for next year´s crop...

This is because the spicy peppers cause the metal to erode very quickly, thereby rendering the axe completely useless.	Axe-man grows a patch of red pepper plants in his back garden. He rubs red peppers on the edge of his axes, and this seems to keep them sharp like brand new.
古	十: ten<br>口: mouth	old	Tombstone and cross on an old man´s grave.	You get OLD fast if you have ten open mouths to feed.
間	門: gate; counter for cannons<br>日: day; sun; Japan; counter for days	interval	The interval between star systems (suns) was too large, so the stargates were created to travel between them.	We open the gates at regular intervals to let a bit of sun in.

I always keep my directions bound to the bottom of my top hat so I won´t lose them.
北	匕: spoon; spoon or katakana hi radical (no. 21)	north	Warning: The left part is NOT the primitive turtle! The stroke order is different.

It has to be in some soft soil that´s easy to dig up, well hidden, and easy to remember like this kanji.	Don´t confuse with place (#1127). Think of location not as a single fixed spot, but as the act of locating. You´ve buried your piggy bank in the dirt in your backyard, but you can´t remember where. You frantically dig everywhere in a process of location to find your piggy bank.
地	土: soil; earth; ground; Turkey<br>也: to be (classical)	ground	Picture the ground as an extent of soil where scorpions are buried like land mines.

There are even more connections to be made among the primitive keywords and the visuals, but i will enter no further...	Think of the classic anime 風の谷のナウシカ (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind). We see Nausicaa entering the valley mouth gliding on an umbrella.

Sorry about this, but Heisig was stupid calling this kanji meadow, used in composite words the most common meaning is ORIGIN...

里	里: village, mile, village radical (no. 166)	ri	The ri is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the GROUND underneath a RICE FIELD.	Hint: Heisig makes here a severe disservice to everyone by using a weird keyword for this character.

戸	戸: door, house, door radical (no. 63)	door	"Traditional Japanese storefront doors have several flags, known as ""noren,"" hanging down from a curtain rod in front of them. I see this as a pseudo-pictograph, and use the horizontal line across the top to represent the curtain rod, since noren don´t usually hang from the ceiling."	A Japanese door has a noren, a flag hanging from a rod. (I give this primitive the meaning of a noren-covered door).
家	宀: shaped crown; katakana u radical (no. 40)<br>豕: pig; hog; pig radical (no. 152)	house	"Think of ""The Three Little Pigs"". There was a house made of straw, another made of sticks, and a third made of bricks, each occupied by a pig. So, naturally, housetop over pig means house, the central element of that story."

[Edit: pogo stick also appears in 1409, 1690, 2530].	Building on gorgon´s story I now change mine to a much more silly and rememberable one. The Chinese police is using a helicopter to check and regulate the traffic. Hanging from the helicopter is a huge chopseal that they utilize to mark some of the cars that are causing trouble on the road.
門	門: gate, gate radical (no. 169)	gates	"Heisig´s stroke order in the 4th edition (and earlier) is wrong, so be careful -- first is the left-most vertical stroke, then draw the rest of the ""sun"" attachment as you would normally.

道	首: neck; counter for songs and poems<br>辶: walk; walking; road radical variant (no. 162)	road-way	When we go out on the ROAD-WAY, we often risk our own necks (that´s why I take the train! ).

Not the modern computer viruses, but the large wooden horse which led to the demise of Troy and of the Trojans. Either its size (much greater than a live horse), or the fact that it conceals things into its belly, will set it appart from the horse primitive that came in frame 568 (""noon"")."

走	土: soil; earth; ground; Turkey	run	Hint: This kanji is NOT soil on top of mend, as Heisig claims - that would duplicate one of the strokes. Instead, it is 10 on top of mend.

Although this kanji´s meaning hasn´t caused me much trouble, I´ve had problems remembering the direction of the drop above king, since drops at tops of kanji often seem to appear in different directions.

第	竹: bamboo<br>弔: condolences; mourning; funeral<br>丿: katakana no radical (no. 4)	No.	The No. 1 currency in the world is the dollar. But, the Asian nations are fast catching up and may in reality have already surpassed it. So, let the bamboo represent the No. 2 currencies (the yen, etc.).

You learn a lesson as you watch it doing so, maybe you learn that “nothing comes for free” or that “one has to be prepared to loose in order to gain”...

A 忍者 is not just a 身 (somebody), it´s 者 who can 忍 great 拷!	Back in the day, the old man used to be someone. His name was in the papers and all that.

See also dilute (#227), clan (#1912), seaweed (#2035).

He had a longnose that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face.

My grandma´s hairpin (just before long (#1920)) is made of silver, the metal that best reflects sun light. I´m sure you can see the flash from her hair as she walks by on a sunny day.

末	木: tree; wood	extremity	The tree has reached the extremity of its growth and no longer produces small, new branches at the top. Instead the existing top branch just grows longer and longer.	There are no great stories for this one yet, and I always forget it.. So, let´s try something ridiculous: The man lived by himself in the wilderness, with no females within miles. So, his only way of relief was to stick his extremity into a small hole in a tree.. The poor guy. Which horizontal stroke is the extremity? The longer one or the shorter one? That, my friends, is up to your own imaginations. I´d prefer not to dwell on that point, myself. ;).
札	木: tree; wood<br>乙: the latter; duplicate; strange; witty; fishhook radical (no. 5)	tag	Botanists like to identify TREEs by HOOKing tags on them.

It also takes on the meaning of Playing Card with the reading of ふだ as in 花札 (Hanafuda cards) or トランプの札 (""trump"" playing cards). For the tag meaning I like to think of wooden tags hung on hooks from trees... but for these other meanings I like to think of both paper money and playing cards as paper (tree) products with the ability to ""hook you in"" so to speak."

No I say, I prefer to eat my PLUMS fresh from the TREE.
械	木: tree; wood<br>戒: commandment	contraption	The ten commandments were heavy. So to help carry them, Moses made a wooden contraption; the ark of the covenant.	Think of a complex wooden contraption capable of giving you a two-handed fiesta.

In desperate need of food you try to set up a snare but the tree is decayed (see story for decay (#1243)) so you catch no prey.

Evaporation anyone?

熱	埶: art<br>火: fire	heat	"Heat up those RICE SEEDLINGS you pulled from the SOIL in a ROUND pan over a low FLAME. (Note: the hot pan image helps reinforce the idea that this kanji for ""atsui"" refers to something hot to the touch, as opposed to hot weather)."	"Just a comment on Erikkusan's story: Although one of the pronunciations of this kanji is ""atsui"" this isn't the atsui that you feel in Tokyo in August, (which is Frame 1260's ""sultry' 暑).

Hence, you see the taskmaster running to the right, trying to stay ahead of the cow."	Hint: This is the kanji from which taskmaster is derived. Actually, this kanji has nothing to do with breed, and a lot to do with pastures and shepherds (also for cowboys, japanese and spanish don´t differenciate between animals). Think of a cowboy (taskmaster) who brings his cows to the pasture.

To help those who struggleded with this, the eaves of a house is usually the bit where you hang the roof gutter along, usually made of zinc or plastic and shaped as a half-pipe. It catches rain water, so it flows to a drain pipe instead of down onto people and windows. And in this family the potato plants grow along the eaves so the water pours down on them.

The fingers of course, a crown (her too short skirt) and her legs below (which to be honest are pretty thick like tree trunks).	"Note: The combination ""crown +human legs"" appears seven times in Heisig. In four cases (nos. 323, 1327, 1328, 2920) the crown is above the human legs, and in the other three cases (1888, 2472, 2679) one leg passes through the crown. The naming is inconsistent, so I call the first pattern ""Miss World"" (who is wearing a crown she won due to her attractive human legs) and the second ""garter"" (one human leg passes through the crown and wears it as a garter)."
推	手: hand<br>隹: bird; old bird radical (no. 172)	conjecture	In mathematics, a conjecture is a mathematical statement which has been proposed as a true statement, but which no one has yet been able to prove or disprove.

晩	日: day; sun; Japan; counter for days<br>免: excuse; dismissal	nightfall	At nightfall the sun excuses itself and goes to sleep.	This is EASY!!! Japanese people see a RABBIT ON THE MOON (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rabbit ) and so nightfall is when the sun leaves to make way for the rabbit.

This is used primarily for weather and climate (and colours).	A massive group of migrating ducks is blocking the warmth of the sun as they pass over your house/barbecue/picnic. Their formation is so humongous they block the warmth for a good 10 minutes while they pass over. Mnemonic for the migrating ducks primitive : the migrating ducks stick together like the best of friends, flying together as one (fifth stroke), they are not easy prey for the great eagles / vultures.
暮	莫: must not; do not; be not<br>日: day; sun; Japan; counter for days	livelihood	He made a livelihood out of robbing GRAVEYARDS in broad DAYlight.	The gravedigger makes his LIVELIHOOD digging in the graveyard all day For graveyard, imagine an idyllic picture: beautiful grass with the sun shining down...and a dog peeing on one of the graves.

For this kanji imagine hundreds of spectators glued to their chairs, then a drum roll and then a cry of ""timber!!!"" as the huge tree crashes to the ground."
欲	谷: valley<br>欠: lack; gap; fail; yawning radical (no. 76)	longing	Guess what? Japanese has dirty words too! (In fact, a lot of them) A sexual story is NOT inappropriate here, as this kanji is very sexual, such as in 性欲; lust.

泉	白: white<br>水: water	spring	White is a symbol of purety, so white water is pure water, the precise definition of spring water.	Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot spring. The kanji is an excellent image of someone enjoying a Japanese hot spring: a little white towel on top, water below. (This helps keep all associations: spring, little and onsen).
洗	水: water<br>先: before; ahead; previous; future; precedence	wash	In Japan, you always wash with water from the shower before you enter the bathtub.	You wash things with WATER to get them back to the clean state they were in BEFORE.

(thanks Elktapestry)."
熟	孰: which; how; who<br>火: fire	mellow	Imagine tall children sitting round the fire toasting marsh-mellows.	The cram school (309) tortures its students - especially the tall and fat ones who need to grow up - over a fire until they mellow. (Note that here the keyword ´mellow´ only means to mature, ripen, or acquire skill; not the colloquial meaning of ´chill out´).
片	片: (a) slice, slice radical (no. 91)	one-sided	Fuaburisu´s pictograph of a man kneeling and presenting the ring to his future wife is a one-sided version of the story. Others say he was giving her the finger.

異	田: rice field; rice paddy<br>共: together; both; neither; all; and; alike; with	uncommon	Brains together with beauty is an uncommon combination.	It´s uncommon to find a pair of together twins who are connected at the brain! When such a set does turn up, they are inevitably showcased on TV.

A very doubtful story: At the entrance to my local zoo they issue you with a special spoon (to feed the animals) and a dart gun (to defend yourself in case of animal attack). You must then hanko (seal) a document to say you’ve received both these items, only after which will they let you enter the zoo. (Oh, and if you forget your hanko, I doubt they’ll let you in).
痛	疒: trailing sickness; sick radical (no. 104)<br>甬: road with walls on both sides	pain	Think of the phrase pain in the xxx. Then think of a pogostick up your xxx. That's painful, right?

Well I wasn´t strong enough to stay up on it and so fell over and have the pain to prove my mum right.
皇	白: white<br>玉: jewel; ball	emperor	Ancient Rome had Emperors instead of Kings, and they wore white robes. Thus an emperor is a king in white. (make sure you picture a roman emperor not a japanese one and you´ll be ok).	The white dove descended on the king and he was promoted to emperor.

Think of the monster from Pan´s Labrynth, that watched over the poor girl with eyes in the palm of his hands.
砂	石: stone<br>少: few; little	sand	Here´s how I remember that stone is on the left. This is because sand starts as stones, and only later they become few.	In good SAND, stones are few, if any.

腰	肉: meat<br>要: need; main point; essence; pivot; key to	loins	If you want to get closer to the actual meaning, then I think that 腰(こし) is more like the hips or the small of the back. After being sat down in the office too long, people often say 腰がいたい！It´s the part of the body that needs massaging.	"To the puritans reading this site - please stop reporting stories that have anything to do with sex! Although (as wrightak said) this kanji really refers to the hips, Heisig clearly chose the keyword ´loins´ because it was anatomically close enough, and the primitives lent themselves to an easy-to-remember story. Just because you´re all sexually repressed doesn´t mean other people won´t benefit from a story such as ""the part of the body people need more than any other are the loins""."

EDIT (2 years later): Keyword ""jump"" leads to confusion later on (see cjon256´s post), ""Dancing"" would be better (but be sure to keep it distinct from dance (#1774)).

He´s probably hiding so the master does not COUNT him with the other animals which will probably be eaten (thus he avoids everyones EQUAL fate on the farm: the kitchen table).	Imagine a magician doing that trick where he puts his assistant in a box and proceeds to saw her in half. Don’t the human legs sticking horizontally out of the box remind you of an equal sign?
鋭	金: gold<br>兌: exchange	pointed	Pointed is the metal devil´s pitchfork.

That´s why they try to keep him locked up in the castle away from the public.	"This one is so tricky for me.

Chances are, he won´t stay on the register for long. My image is close to that of gorgon´s story.	This doctor dilutes (see 227) his patients with bamboo stalks rather than the flowers of a standard diluting acupuncturist hence he needs to be on the Bamboo Accumpunturist Diltuers (BAD) register.

Gremlins find water a little too nourishing, as it makes them instantly multiply.

To everybody else it is an origami, but to them it is also a symbol of their vows. -- ""the folded words are vows"".

剛	岡: mount; hill; knoll<br>刀: sword; saber; knife	sturdy	Mount everest is very sturdy, you can hit it all day with a saber and it wont even wobble.	Anything sturdy in Japan is associated with Mount Fuji. Perhaps this is because it´s symmetry is believed to make it rather sturdy itself, unlike all those crooked mountains that are around and tend to fall apart (think rock slides, avalanches, etc.).

It was uncomfortable, though, how your uncle (#718) often touched you just a little above the crotch (叔) when coaching...

搬	手: hand<br>般: carrier; carry; all	conveyor	When workers neglect workplace safety, their fingers get cut off and carried away by the conveyor belt, which looks like a ´finger carrier´ in that case.	During WWII, morse code was the primary means of communication from sea.

Following -て form of another verb, means ""to do the favor of"": 窓を開けて呉れませんか, ""Won't you open the window [do the favor of opening/kindly open the window]?"" Usu. written in hiragana."	I see this as a pictograph of an old-style phonograph - a stand, record, crank and bell (the mouth). Even the primitives work out - a tool with a crank which plays music out of the bell mouth.

The directors were so impressed that they let him stunt double for Hannibal in a few episodes. OR, Mr T chiefin´ on some crack cocaine. You make the call.
